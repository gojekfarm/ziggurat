## [1.6.1] 2022-02-17

# Added

- The function `rabbitmq.GetRetryCount` is now exposed and can be used to get the retry count without having to do
  manual assertions

## [1.6.0] 2022-02-13

# Changes

- changes internal retry structure for RabbitMQ

# Breaking Changes

- The RabbitMQ `QueueConfig` now uses `QueueKey` instead of `QueueName`

## [1.5.1] 2022-01-28

# Added

- consumer config now takes in a new option called `PartititionAssignment` which is used to configure how kafka
  partitions are assigned to a consumer

## [1.5.0] 2022-01-07

# Changes

- Kafka consumer default `PollTimeout` is `100 ms`
- `ConsumerGroupID` is renamed to `GroupID` and `OriginTopics` is renamed to `Topics` to keep it consistent with kafka
  terminology
- The run loop for kafka consumer polling has been restructured.

# Removed

- The server package only exposes a Run method which orchestrates an HTTP Server rather than providing a full web server
  implementation
- `httprouter` dependency has been removed

## [1.4.5] 2021-12-16

# Changes

- Exposes the ARetry struct from RabbitMQ

## [1.4.4] 2021-12-16

# Added

- RabbitMQ MW adds a header `retry-origin:ziggurat-go` to identify the message retry source

  goroutines

## [1.4.3] 2021-10-20

# Changes

- fixes go-routine leak in the Dead set replay handler

## [1.4.2] 2021-10-19

# Breaking changes

- kafka messages now use the route group to route messages, `<route_group>/<topic>/<partition>`. Usage
  of `<bootstrap_server>/<consumer_group>/<topic>/<partition>` is deprecated as this makes the path very long and routes
  become difficult to configure.
